## Simulators of Langmuir-Hinshelwood reactions in nanoparticle catalysis
This repository provides a particle-resolved reactionâˆ’diffusion simulation tool for bimolecular (two components, A and B) Langmuir-Hinshelwood reactions on a spherical catalyst. Panel (a) shows the simulation system, in which a yellow sphere embedded at the center of the simulation box is the nanoparticle catalyst.
